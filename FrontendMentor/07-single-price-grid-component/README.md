## My process
Used Css grid just for larger layouts, and flexbox on pontual stuff
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- SASS Builtin Modules
- SASS new @use @forward
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM CSS Methodology
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Used thos project to pratice how to use SASS without the @import keyword, since it's being soon depreciated and to learn some other sass built in modules
